# linux-scripts

My collection of some handy bash scripts, some of them got dependencies so
my advice is to read at least the comments in the script

## Add scripts to PATH

Add the script path to your PATH environment variable so you can use them
in a terminal whatever your current working directory.

Clone the repository to, in this example, "scripts", and add following to 
your .bashrc, .zshrc or whatever shell you're using.

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/scripts:$PATH"
```
